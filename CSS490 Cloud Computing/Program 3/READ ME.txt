Program Description: This program will make a back up of a directory and all sub-directories to the AWS E3 cloud. In addition, if a file is no longer in the directory, the file will be deleted from the S3 bucket

Notes:
Libraries that are needed
	boto3
	botocore
	argparse
	hashlib
	sys
	os
	configparser from six.moves

	If you are missing one of the libraries above, use the command pip install <lib> in command prompt to install
	Please note that many of these libraries are included with python, but you will most likely need to install boto3
Built and Tested on Python 3.6

How to build an EXE
Before you start, you will need a python library called PyInstaller. To install, type the command 'pip install pyinstaller' into command prompt. You will also need Python 3.6 installed to run.
In addition, you will also need boto3. Use the command 'pip install boto3'. If pip is not working, your python environment may not be set up properly. See this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23708898/pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command
Steps:
1. Open command Prompt/Terminal
2. Change directory to the location of the .py file. Use the command cd <location>
3. Run the command 'pyinstaller.exe -F --debug all backup.py'. This will create three new folders
4. Open the folder called dist and you will find the backup.exe file

How to Run the program
You have two choices when running this program. Using the EXE file or running the source code.
Please ensure that your AWS credentials are set up. Also ensure your config file is set to region us-west-1
Built and Tested on Python 3.6. Please use Python 3.6

To run the EXE:
1.Double click it. This is not recommended because the window will not stay open if successful or if it encounters errors
RECOMMEDED
1. Open command Prompt/Terminal
2. Change directory to the location of the EXE file. Use the command cd <location>
3. Type 'backup.exe' to run default parameters or ' backup.exe [-h] [--bucket BUCKET] [--path PATH]' to run with command line arguements
	Note: The Default bucket is css490program3defaultbucketname. If someone else is using this, it will cause an error
	BUCKET: This should be an existing bucket in your S3
	PATH: The absolute path to the folder you want to back up
4. Click enter. Done

To run Python code file:
1. Open command Prompt/Terminal
2. Change directory to the location of the .py file. Use the command cd <location>
3. Type 'python backup.py' to run default parameters or 'python backup.py [-h] [--bucket BUCKET] [--path PATH]' to run with command line arguements
	Note: The Default bucket is css490program3defaultbucketname. If someone else is using this, it will cause an error and ask you to re-run using a different bucket.
	BUCKET: This should be an existing bucket in your S3
	PATH: The absolute path to the folder you want to back up
4. Click enter. Done
